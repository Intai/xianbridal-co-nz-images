## Convention
- File name is the product ID. e.g. `304TA.jpg` or `304TA.png` is the first photo for product `304TA`.
- File name is indexed if there are multiple. e.g. `304TA-1.jpg` is the second photo for product `304TA`.
- File name contains the width. e.g. `304TA-1-2000.webp` has a width of 2000 pixels for product `304TA`.
- Serve .webp at widths of 200, 500, 1000, 2000, and the original width (as max) for better compression. Skip any target width larger than the original. Have the original width in .webp file name as well.
- Use `cwebp` command line for compression.
